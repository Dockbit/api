**Important**: Dockbit API is under development and has not yet been officially released. The specification below might (and most probably will) change. Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dockbit) to get notified about changes to our platform API.

## API format

The API fully follows version 1.0 of the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/) specificiation.

## Authorization

In order to authenticate your requests, log in to [Dockbit](https://dockbit.com), navigate to [Account Settings](https://dockbit.com/settings) and copy your personal _API key_. For convenience, let's export it as an environment variable:

```bash
export DOCKBIT_API_KEY=<Paste your API key here>
```

You can now pass the key in the Authorization header as `Authorization: Bearer $DOCKBIT_API_KEY`. See below for example requests.
